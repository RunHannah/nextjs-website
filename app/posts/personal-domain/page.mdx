# Hello, new website! 

Well, it only took a layoff for me to finally get around to using the personal domain I bought last summer. If thereâ€™s ever a perfect time to set up your custom domain, itâ€™s definitely after a job loss. ðŸ˜…

But in all seriousness, this site/time has given me the chance to experiment with the latest features of React 19/Next.js 15, and try other things. To get MDX and markdown hooked up I watched this tutorial and copied pasta some code to get me started: [MDX with Next.js App Router](https://youtu.be/34bRv6cQezo?si=vSsoB6tCQvHaHloQ). Eventually, I'd like to use a headless CMS and change some other things.

Anyway, hereâ€™s to finally checking something off my to-do list. If youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™ll find a mix of tech/projects, career musings, and maybe even a spot to waste a minute. Either way, thanks for stopping by!
